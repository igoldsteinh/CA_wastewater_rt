# Rt estimates for California from Gene Concentrations
Source code and output of estimating Rt from SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations for California counties. The methodology is described in [``Semiparametric inference of effective reproduction number dynamics from wastewater pathogen surveillance data"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15770). Data comes from [California Open Data Portal](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/covid-19-wastewater-surveillance-data-california).
